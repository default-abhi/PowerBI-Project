## Procedures
### Procedure Undertaken

1. **Calendar Heat Map**  
   - Created a dynamic calendar heat map that adjusts automatically based on the selected month from a slicer.  
   - Designed each day on the calendar to be color-coded based on sales volume, with darker shades indicating higher sales.  
   - Implemented interactive tooltips to display detailed metrics such as Sales, Orders, and Quantity when hovering over specific calendar days.  

2. **Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends**  
   - Segmented sales data into two categories: weekdays and weekends.  
   - Analyzed performance variations between these categories to identify significant differences in sales patterns.  
   - Provided detailed insights into the sales behavior during weekdays versus weekends.  

3. **Sales Analysis by Store Location**  
   - Visualized sales data across different store locations for better understanding and comparison.  
   - Incorporated month-over-month (MoM) difference metrics based on the selected month from the slicer.  
   - Highlighted the MoM increase or decrease in sales for each store location to uncover trends and performance changes.
